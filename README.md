# WeatherForecast

This is my personal project of a weather application.

It uses openweathermap.org 's API to get and show the data matching your query that you type in the search bar.




# Use-case:
1.Clone this repository, build and run the program to be greeted by the following GUI.

2.Click on the searchbar and type the name of the city, then click the "Search" button or press enter to check the weather.

3.You should see all the information displayed along the bottom edge of the application.

# Motivation:

  -javaFX,
  
  -REST Api, 
  
  -Maven,
  
  -gson package to map the json object to a class,
  
  -scene builder and css,
  
  -Junit,
  
  # Possible future functionalites:
  -getting data about pollution occuring at the area in question and plotting it against time.
